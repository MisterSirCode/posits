# Rust Posits
A learning experiment of mine to try and understand Posits

This is a simple numeric extension to Posits in rust.

Currently only supports converting Posits to Floats, and not the reverse.

Types implemented: `p8`, `p16`, `p32`, `p64`

Validate type conversion under `posits::extra::unit_tests()`

Float conversion and posit algebra is in the works
